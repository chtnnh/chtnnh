## hey, i am chtnnh
_the fastest growing software engineer in the world._

### the present
_the past is irrelevant, much like the future..._

i've put all my bets on altering the future of humanity with decentralized federated machine learning.

### the past
_...unless you're reminiscing to build a better future._

- full stack swe @ [WisdomCircle](https://wisdomcircle.com)
- [buildspace](https://buildspace.so) n&w s2 & s3 - (attempted) founder @ Rituals
  - gamifying habit formation for neurodivergent adults
  - realised gamifying habit formation requires a greater product-aligned mindset, which i didn't possess then
  - will probably attempt to solve this problem again
- swe intern @ [BharatX](https://bharatx.tech)
- (attempted) founder @ unnamed
  - designing machine learning algorithms to, well one day, build a high-bandwidth BCI
  - realised that there is a reason why machine learning algorithms weren't built on top of open source electrode data
  - will _definitely_ attempt to solve this problem again, hopefully soon
- [Kernel](https://kernel.community) Block 4 Fellow @ [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co)
- swe intern @ [Questbook](https://questbook.xyz)
- (attempted) founder @ QubEat
  - designing quantum algorithms to solve optimisation for logistics
  - got off track trying to prove that "P = NP", realised i love physics but our universe might not have been the same if that permutation of those 5 characters was true
  - will probably attempt to solve this problem again, much later though
